# chaOS
This a primitive OS build using COSMOS on Visual Studio 17.
This has a few features.
1. A about section where you get a little info about what COSMOS framework is.
2. A basic calculator.
3. A shutdown feature.
I wish to include more features like GUI, mouse pointer integration to go with it.
The code is implemented using C# and is very easy to understand and play around with.
First download Visual Studio 17.
Next download COSMOS USER kit.
and click on Osproject.sln file to work with it. 
Use a virtualisation software like VMware or Bochs to run this primitve OS.
